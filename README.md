# WhatsAnalyzer

WhatsAnalyzer is a Node application with a simple idea:

– takes in the supplied WhatsApp export (the text file you get from exporting a chat) and analyzes it

– shows info/statistics of the chat

Usage is very straightforward: `node whatsanalyzer <path to export>`

Hope you learn something new about your chats!
